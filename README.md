Tere bare mein sochu to
Halke se apne plans bhul jata hu,
Tu sath rahe to din ban jata hain,
Awaz tera sunu to apnapn lgta hain,
Tujhe dekhu to lgta hain kismat wala hu jo har roz ye chehra dekh pata hu...

Hatho mein hath dale waqt ho gaya tha,
Ye hath bejan ki tarha sakt ho gaya tha,
Jab tere hatho mein hath dala,
To laga iss bewaqt ka bhi waqt hogaya tha...

Some people believe there is a one, 
The one who points your way to the sun.
A person they believe makes them complete
The one who will support when facing defeat

'You are my  angel,' my one and only
My forever love, so we'll never be lonely.
You've brought to my life all your love and care
It made me see when I realized how rare
. .
It is to meet your angel, or their lifetime one
Through you and my children, whose life has begun.

What you've done, you've illuminated my soul
It's you and your love that has made me whole.
The feel of your love, your soft touch and caress,
We're tight so close, your heart beats in my chest.

All that we have always felt missing before
Though I love you today, tomorrow it will be more.
Our love is life, we are the strongest tree
Which will always grow forever, like you and me.

You have opened my heart and held it so dear
You are my angel, and will always keep it near.
You have seen my ups and cared when I was low.
'You are my angel,' I just need you to know.

You entered my life through a ray of sun above 
And when we leave, we will leave together in love
My love for you has become my reason to be
I hope one day you'll find your angel in me.


"Back in school you once asked about "has it ever felt like wind blowing, your hairs flying, backgroud music playing, and you're alone with the one person"",  boy said.

"This is the moment I was talking about, dumbo", girl whispered
